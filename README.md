# Particle Builder 🌌

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to Particle Builder! Our mission is to transform the beloved board game "Particle Builder" into an immersive online experience.

### Version
Version 1.2. Last updated on 17/03/2024

### Developers 
TechLauncher, Australian National University, Australia

### Background 
Particle Builder, a captivating board game designed to educate students about particle physics, has garnered significant attention since its inception. With over 10,000 views, 2,000 downloads, and recognition on [CERN's Website](https://scoollab.web.cern.ch/particle-physics-games), it has proven to be a valuable resource for educators. However, its current format requires extensive setup, including printing, cutting, and laminating, posing a considerable challenge for educators.

### Objective 
Our goal is to streamline the Particle Builder experience by bringing it online. By preserving the original rules and graphics, our aim is to create an accessible digital version. At the minimum viable product (MVP) level, players will engage in level one of the game against a rudimentary computer opponent. Subsequent enhancements may include additional levels, multiplayer functionality, or more sophisticated AI opponents. Upon completion of the MVP, our team intends to conduct extensive evaluations with final year high school students and physics educators across the ACT, culminating in a comprehensive research paper documenting our findings.
